iCoo, an online syndicalist, cooperative platform.

THIS IS A PROTOTYPE using Vue with Ionic, connecting to a Matrix back end.

CONCEPT:

iCoo is an application for establishing connections and communication between socio-economic groups for their common participation, syndicalisation and federation of activities.

The app's basic premise is straight forward. It is a social platform where users can join various groups, but groups also are able to join other groups.

So if say, we want to set up a flea market, we can create a collaboration between the different groups and the activities they engage in to put together the resouces needed to make that flea market happen.
Someone may have a group that is into transport by bikes. Another may be into the collecting of recyclables, another may be into cooking food and yet another may be in possession of related infrastructure, like tables and tents.
These groups then join the larger group called "Flea Market on the 10th of May" where they participate, plan for the day and communicate during its execution.
The flea market may in this way be a one-off event, or created as a continuing group that sets up a flea market once a week or month. For separation, groups may or may not have an associated timestamp.

Groups joining groups works like this: When Group A joins Group B, Group A will be presented as a link inside Group B. The members of Group A are then all given an invite request to join Group B as individuals, and they may individually choose to join or not. This design is meant to encourage grass roots discussion and democracy within Group B, where every member is the same, rather than a hierarchy or the subdividing of participants. When subdivision is needed, subgroups provide the needed functionality.

Users and Groups are searchable through names and tags. The "feed" of the app is a calendar which presents the user with their upcoming activities.  iCoo is organised as a "tab application", divided into three tabs which are the Calendar, Groups and Users. A group that contains a timestamp will show up in the calendar along with any custom reminders the user creates for themselves. The Calendar and Groups tabs therefore displays the same thing: Groups. The goal of the calendar is to not just be a basic calendar presentation, but an interface that may present formats like gantt charts or schedules showing chronological connections and relationships between different activities and their related groups.

The groups tab presents groups in four different categories. Joined groups, Invitation pending, Public searchable groups, and Kickstart, explained below.
The three basic categories are self explanatory, but Kickstart, or "Kickstarter for People" is a concept within the app where new projects or specific activities can be advertised and presented in such a way as to attract new members, be they individuals or groups, to discover and take part in new efforts. In this interface, individuals or groups can express their enthusiasm or ability to dedicate themselves to new efforts in different ways. Once enough resources have been gathered, the originator may choose to procede.

Every group hosts three different categories of basic content. They are chat rooms, subgroups and boards.

Chat rooms are pretty straight forward. They behave as posts on facebook and contain a hierarchical presentation of the conversation, like a discussion board like reddit (minus the upvote system). This is to provide separation and structure to conversations and the information communicated in them.

Subgroups are fully fledged groups that exist inside the larger group. These are meant for dividing tasks, working groups or jobs related to the group's efforts into smaller facilities with their separate concerns.

Boards contain items like lists, rosters, spreadsheets, voting apps, minutes of meetings, visualisations, recorded VoIPs, a constitution or other items not related to simple conversation or subgrouping. Individual settings for each item regarding permissions to view or edit is applicable.

Chats, Board items and Subgroups may be shared between different groups seamlessly for wider communication and collaboration. Individual settings for sharing can be set for each item. This could for example be a subgroup within "Flea Market on the 10th of May" concerned with transport, that the participants from the transport group may choose to share to their own group page for access there. It could also be an announcement from one group to another, or a conversation where participants that would not otherwise be sharing a space, are able to integrate and communicate around a specific topic.

A fourth tab that could and should be built, but is not included in this prototype is one that presents activities and concerns to the consumer end. This should however, in my opinion, be built as a separate app. This is because participation and consumption are very separate activities and its integration directly into this app would serve to clog up an app that is already struggling to fit onto the screen of a cell phone. An argument for integrating both into the same app is that it opens the door wider to those seeking to consume, to later actual participation.
In any case, a proof of concept for such an app has already been plenty built in apps like facebook or meetup, and does not require demonstration.

TECHNICAL ASPECTS:

The node environment variables contain different login information, so that different users can be presented in the browser through individual development servers to test and develop interaction between different users.


HISTORY AND CONTEXT:

iCoo was first concieved of in the summer of 2020 at the beginning of the covid pandemic and was envisioned as an alternative to capitalist economic activity in the anticipation of a global economic depression and the consequential dearth of capital for providing people with jobs. The primary concern was to help mitigate civil unrest and subsequent conflict. When the economic downturn was prevented by government intervention, I shelved the project because I could not figure a way for the app to be able to achieve the critical user mass that would be required for it to be able to be functional, and so I concluded that the platform would never be able to get off the ground. After joining Extinction Rebellion which organises in this exact way later that year, I had a change of heart. The development since then has been slow moving. I am a self-taught programmer (and my apologies for the state of the code) doing this on my part time and I have not been able of attracting more participants for the project.
I have come to the realisation that this project probably can't be realised, as I once hoped, as a grass roots, volunteer basis, and that money will have to be raised for salaries to developers. Programmers do, after all, have to eat. 
Ironically, it could be that, had iCoo already existed, a grass roots effort could perhaps have been viable, but alas, it does have to be built first.

I later realised that what the app describes are not new concepts. They are in fact already well described of in anarchist, syndicalist and parecon theories. Because of previous working anarchist organisation, along with my witnessing the functional organisational model of Extinction Rebellion, I regard the other proof of concept, the viability of these activities and econopmic organisation to be well established. I am of the strong belief that this platform, if correctly implemented, will work very well.

The app, once made, is to be published under a Copyleft licence.
